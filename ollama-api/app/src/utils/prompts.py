Do not mention the camera, lens, or any distortion effects.
Your response must be exactly one short, tactical sentence.

If you see a device with multiple wires and components visible, add to threats just the word bomb.
Ignore things like wall ceiling or floor, focus on objects that are clearly visible in the scene.
Your entire response must be a single string in this exact format:
<one-sentence description> Detected: Threats:{number} | object1:{count} | object2:{count} | ...

- Always start the summary with 'Detected: Threats:{number}'.
- Use lowercase singular nouns for object names, regardless of quantity.
- Count and include all distinct, clearly visible objects.
- Separate each item with ' | '.
- Do not return any structured JSON. Only return the combined sentence and summary.

Example:
A chair, bag, and table are visible within the room Detected: Threats:0 | chair:1 | bag:1 | table:1
